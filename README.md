# Swire_Capstone
A time series analysis of product demand for future releases

**Business Problem (as team presented):**  
Swire is set to introduce a range of innovative products and requests a reliable forecast model to predict the demand for each. The overall objective is to leverage historical data for similar products to forecast the demand for the new flavors at specific locations within a 13-week range. Additionally, the incorporation of relevant census data is critical to derive insightful business conclusions, such as identifying ideal locations or demographics for the different products based on prior sales. The approach to this project can be broad, encompassing a demand forecast for each innovation product, or in-depth, focusing on a select few products while considering factors like seasonality, trends, and other influencers. Success will be measured by the accuracy of the demand forecasts and the ability to provide actionable insights for strategic decision-making. The project scope includes the execution of the forecast model by the data science team to be presented upon completion, with the potential for additional enhancements in the future.

Benefiting from a reliable forecast model, Swire aims to make data-driven decisions for the introduction of its new products, optimizing inventory management, and ensuring customer satisfaction. Stakeholders will judge the success of the project based on the accuracy of demand forecasts and the resulting actionable insights. The analytics approach will focus on the utilization of historical and census data to construct a robust forecast model, enabling informed decision-making for product introduction and market positioning. Potentially, additional market factors will be evaluated to achieve a deeper understanding of sales data. The project scope includes the execution of the forecast model with flexibility for potential enhancements based on project milestones and evolving business requirements.
